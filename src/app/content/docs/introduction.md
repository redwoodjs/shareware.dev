## 🚀 What Is an Add-On?

An add-on is a package of functionality that plugs into a RedwoodSDK app. It might include:
- Routes, pages, or components
- Actions or services
- Durable Object logic
- Tailwind or BaseUI styling
- Installation scripts and setup instructions

Each add-on is isolated, composable, and built to follow RedwoodSDK’s minimal, transparent approach to full-stack development.

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here
- A growing library of community- and core-maintained add-ons
- Clear documentation and install instructions for each package
- Tools to help you publish and maintain your own add-ons
- Guidelines to ensure consistency, security, and great developer experience

## ❤️ Built by the RedwoodJS Community

Shareware.dev is maintained by the core RedwoodJS team and open to contributions from the wider ecosystem. It’s inspired by the spirit of old-school shareware: try it, tweak it, build on it, and pass it on.

Let’s build something awesome—together.
